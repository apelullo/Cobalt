A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated. This is not designed to encourage yoga or mindfulness but rather to offer strategies that help people cope, which we all do differently. If you can’t sleep and feel the degree of anxiety you describe, maybe there are other types of intervention that might help you feel a little bit better while we all wait for the “real root” to get addressed?

Currently I am being asked to take on new roles with which I have no prior experience and receiving no training or support. My past experiences with HR have been unhelpful. How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support. And as always, if you feel bullied and hence unsafe, SafetyNet remains an available resource to make your concerns known.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,2

I am pregnant (early in the second trimester) and very worried about working and contracting COVID-19. I have been trying to keep up to date on precautions for pregnant women and have been vigilant about hand washing and trying not to touch my face, get proper sleep/nutrition etc but I am scared for my baby. My pregnancy is considered high risk for other reasons and the only reassuring information I have seen comes from women who contracted the disease in their 3rd trimester and since I am only in the beginning of the second I am not sure what that means for my baby and me. I am also having a lot of anxiety thinking about needing to be in an ICU and what would happen to my baby. What if I am not able to be present for the birth or what if my baby gets sick too? What if I need to be separated from my baby after they are born? These thoughts bring me anxiety and sadness. I know my husband is also worried about me going to work and we are trying to stay safe but feel like this is out of our control. How can I best protect myself and my baby? Will someone advocate for me if I can't advocate for us?
A: We appreciate that working during this pandemic, particularly as we are still learning about the virus, can be very anxiety provoking and pregnant women have many important questions and concerns while navigating how to best protect themselves. I am attaching a FAQ for pregnant women that was developed in conjunction with OB/GYN, Pediatrics, and ID physicians at Penn and CHOP which can give you some further information.  I am also attaching Penn's guidance on working with COVID-19 infected patients for pregnant employees, and I would encourage you to have a dedicated discussion with your manager regarding your work environment and modifications made to keep you safe at this time. HR and Infection Control are also available to discuss with you at any time - and we really appreciate your dedication and want to keep you as safe as possible. Finally, if you're having trouble managing your anxiety, don't forget to consult the PennMedicineTogether website for the many resources now available to help you through it.

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.
