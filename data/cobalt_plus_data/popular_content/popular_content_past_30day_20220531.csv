As with all staff, I recommend you continue to follow closely our universal mask policy, perform frequent hand hygiene and cleaning of high touch surfaces including your phone, and follow all isolation and personal protective equipment guidelines if you care with patients with known or confirmed COVID-19. Everyone should be aware of any new symptoms such as cough or trouble breathing, or any other signs of infection such as fever, chills, malaise - and contact your doctor and manager right away if you develop any of these.

As a resident, I think it is very unsafe to be going in to speak and exam known covid positive patients with a surgical mask that is paper thin and for many of us, too large for our faces to the point where we feel air from the sides. As this is reported to be an airborne virus where particles remain in the air, I think it is unsafe and disrespectful to ask residents to take that risk when we have families at home who are prone to infection and are witnessing young patients like ourselves in the icu intubated. We have received emails about how many N95 donations we have received yet as the primary caretakers we are not seeing these masks and being told we are unable to obtain them when performing swabs, which per CDC guidelines is considered an aerosolizing procedure. I am overall disappointed and upset at the safety measures that have been put in place by penn medicine and hope that this is discussed in further detail. 


A: I appreciate your concerns about your safety while caring for COVID-19 patients. Based on the available data, we believe the virus is transmitted primarily through droplet route and contact of secretions with mucus membranes, with risk of airborne transmission only during aerosol generating procedures. In this setting, we are following the CDC and WHO guidance for contact, droplet, and eye protection during routine care of COVID-19 patients, and using respirators and PAPRs for aerosol generating procedures. We are prioritizing negative pressure rooms at present for critically ill patients and as many COVID patients as we can, and navigating increasing patient volumes. Our goal is to keep all of our staff safe, and provide respirators and PAPRs when the clinical situation necessitates risk of airborne transmission. We do not consider performing an NP swab to be an aerosol generating procedure based on available data, and feel that staff are safe performing this in gowns, gloves, face masks, and eye protection.  Face masks and eye protection will protect you from any droplet sized particles getting into your mouth, eyes, and nose.   We completely understand your concern about keeping your self and your family safe, and this is also our priority.  And we appreciate that our teams are working to take excellent care of our patients through a time of many unknowns.

One of my colleague, just return to work after being tested positive, he did 12 days of isolation. The management did not communicate anything about is return with the other employees. Even if they are following the recommendations, it will be wise to share such information with the others who are putting they life on the line. the employee who returned is young (23 years old), others are more older with preexisting health conditions. The fact is that, the recommendations from the CDC are changing periodically as we advance in the situation. None of the experts on COVID 19 have made a clear statement about immunity that one may get from the disease and how long it may last. Even, about re-infestation, there is not much information. Thus, we should inform employees when one of them is returning after being positive for COVID 19 (without violating HIPAA) in order for some of them to express their concern and maybe leave because they are in the high risk of the mortality for COVID 19. Those employee should be protected when they leave. This may help reduce the fatality rate that have been projected. Sincerely, Thank you.

A: The current CDC and PA Department recommendations for healthcare workers retuning to work if they have had COVID-19 are that people need to be at least 7 days from symptom onset, with improving symptoms, and no fevers for 72 hours (and have not taken any medications to reduce the fever). This is based on what we know at present about viral shedding and infectivity after infection. Our occupational health and infection control teams discuss in person with each person returning to work to ensure it is safe to do so. While we are learning about the disease, this is expert guidance on balancing what we know about infectivity and healthcare workers essential to the workforce and patient care. Our priority is the health and safety of our staff and we are closely monitoring any new information available. Our goal is also to protect the privacy of our staff, and so we work behind the scenes and through your manager to ensure you have the information that is necessary for your safety. Our universal masking policy is also designed to help protect you at work. If you have specific concerns about your health status or underlying conditions that may pre-dispose you to more severe disease, please discuss with occupational health - we can help give individual guidance.","Kathleen M Murphy, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases",,1

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

Maria noticed that patients had to exit the echo lab by wading their way through the lines of people waiting for a COVID -19 vaccine, as the clinic is located in the lobby of the new pavilion at CCH. She was concerned about the immunocompromised patients exiting and exposure to risk. In response, Maria and her staff suggested an alternate exit to protect patients. During a leadership rounding visit, Maria shared the altered patient flow. Hospital leadership has learned about this and other staff-initiated improvements by regularly walking the hospital floor and seeing first-hand the changes that are improving healthcare delivery at CCH.
