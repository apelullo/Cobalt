My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,18

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand.

Cultural Humility focuses on lifelong learning, self-reflection, removing power differentials (such as provider and patient) and demonstrating equal respect for different beliefs and points of view. The construct of cultural competence assumes that one can learn or know enough, that cultures are monolithic, and that one can reach a full understanding of a culture to which they do not belong.

In contrast, cultural humility encourages ongoing personal reflection and growth around culture in order to increase awareness and introspection. Cultural Humility is one of the core values of the Action for Cultural Transformation (ACT), a system-wide effort organized as a roadmap to eliminate structural racism across our institution. While we acknowledge that we cannot as individuals be competent in a culture other than our own, we can:

Work to reduce health disparities
Improve access to high-quality healthcare
Be respectful of and responsive to the needs of diverse patients

When we are committed to the practice of Cultural Humility, we can:

Create an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all
Improve patient care
Build a workplace that keeps and attracts high quality employees

-The practice of cultural humility involves viewing every encounter, be it with a patient or colleague, as a negotiation between two worldviews.
-Promoting an inclusive culture benefits not only those who work, train, study and/or advance science within our health system, but also those who seek care here and their family caregivers.
-When we value each other, it enhances our ability to care for our patients.

Cultural Humility is one of the behaviors that are essential for delivering the Penn Medicine Experience. 
Focusing on the ""Demonstrates Self-Awareness"" and ""Values Differences"" competencies can help enhance your practice of Cultural Humility which positively impacts patient care and our work environment.

So, Gabriella and I workshopped three new questions that focused on lived experiences and the ability to work well with people from different backgrounds.  

We hope our enhanced interview questions will give applicants a better understanding of what we stand for here in the lab. As Gabriella put it, “everyone deserves to feel seen, heard, and respected in the workplace, and that should start with the interview process.”  

The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Candidates tell us they’re not used to being asked those kinds of questions, but they see the value. For our part, we’ve learned a lot about the candidates from their answers to those questions that we never would have known otherwise.  

Gabriella is headed towards medical school, and I’m sorry to have her go, but eager to see all she can accomplish in this field. She brings with her the tenacity to stick with a problem until she can find a solution, and deep empathy for our patients. Gabriella credits her work at Penn Medicine as a major reason for continuing her studies. “I’ve been inspired by the dedication and expertise of the Penn Medicine physicians that I’ve worked with over the past year.”

I hope the small changes we made to the interview questions will demonstrate how important it is to bring many different perspectives into play—in hiring as well as in our day-to-day interactions at work.",Penn Medicine Experience,8,3

 As a social worker in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN), I serve the whole family: the baby, the birth parent, and any other parents or loved ones who are involved in the baby’s care. One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them. So, I wrote “mama” for each parent in the baby’s chart and in the birth parent’s chart. I made sure all my colleagues were using the correct terms to refer to the parents.   

As the family was leaving the hospital, the parents told me how much they appreciated being asked what they wanted to be called. I want all my patients to feel that I hear and care about them.

I coordinate Let’s Talk, Lancaster, a coalition of community partners dedicated to supporting mental health and wellness in our community. At one of our monthly workshops to advance trauma responsive practices, the facilitator took us through an exercise to help us reflect on our differences. We drew a circle on a piece of paper and then added a facial feature for every social connection we had with a person from a different background in our childhood.  

I looked down at the paper and saw one eye on an otherwise blank face. Seeing that image really struck me. I realized I can’t see what I haven’t lived.  

One way I can make a difference is to look at my sphere of influence, and make sure there are more seats at the table. Recently, we were reviewing a job description for a trauma-informed specialist position that required a bachelor’s degree, and I wondered if this degree was really needed for the work. After discussing it with the people who work closely with that position, we concluded that experience with trauma-informed care was just as important as having the degree.  

So we changed the job description to require either a bachelor’s degree or lived experience. That position could be filled by someone who may not have been considered before, who would bring a lot of experience into the room in addition to training. Someone who would help to broaden our lens as mental health care providers.

Two questions: 1)I keep hearing about using N95s or PAPRs for known COVID positive or PUI suspected positive patients during aerosol-generating procedures, ie. suctioning, intubation, CPR, etc. However, to me, all that means is that those procedures are more likely to induce COUGHING, which generates aerosols. WHY then, when a patient is NOT INTUBATED (or source controlled, ie wearing a mask), are we instructed to abide by wearing droplet and contact isolation. WE SHOULD BE WEARING N95s! 2) Will we be getting the full face shields (forehead to below chin coverage) I see being used in NYC and other hospitals? that seems safer than what we are provided with at HUP currently. Thank you.
A: We do not consider coughing to be an aerosol generating situation that requires airborne precautions. Negative pressure and N95/PAPRs at this time are needed only for aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, open suctioning, non-invasive ventilation such as  BiPAP or high flow nasal cannula, nebulizers, etc. For patient care otherwise, unless anticipating an aerosol generating procedure (ie tenuous respiratory status requiring potential intubation, etc) droplet and contact precautions with eye covering is appropriate. We are prioritizing negative pressure rooms and airborne precautions as we are able for critically ill patients. We are rapidly increasing our supply of full face shields and supplying these to staff, as they are an additional way to protect your eyes and entire face, and conserve masks on COVID patient units.

As a resident, I think it is very unsafe to be going in to speak and exam known covid positive patients with a surgical mask that is paper thin and for many of us, too large for our faces to the point where we feel air from the sides. As this is reported to be an airborne virus where particles remain in the air, I think it is unsafe and disrespectful to ask residents to take that risk when we have families at home who are prone to infection and are witnessing young patients like ourselves in the icu intubated. We have received emails about how many N95 donations we have received yet as the primary caretakers we are not seeing these masks and being told we are unable to obtain them when performing swabs, which per CDC guidelines is considered an aerosolizing procedure. I am overall disappointed and upset at the safety measures that have been put in place by penn medicine and hope that this is discussed in further detail. 


A: I appreciate your concerns about your safety while caring for COVID-19 patients. Based on the available data, we believe the virus is transmitted primarily through droplet route and contact of secretions with mucus membranes, with risk of airborne transmission only during aerosol generating procedures. In this setting, we are following the CDC and WHO guidance for contact, droplet, and eye protection during routine care of COVID-19 patients, and using respirators and PAPRs for aerosol generating procedures. We are prioritizing negative pressure rooms at present for critically ill patients and as many COVID patients as we can, and navigating increasing patient volumes. Our goal is to keep all of our staff safe, and provide respirators and PAPRs when the clinical situation necessitates risk of airborne transmission. We do not consider performing an NP swab to be an aerosol generating procedure based on available data, and feel that staff are safe performing this in gowns, gloves, face masks, and eye protection.  Face masks and eye protection will protect you from any droplet sized particles getting into your mouth, eyes, and nose.   We completely understand your concern about keeping your self and your family safe, and this is also our priority.  And we appreciate that our teams are working to take excellent care of our patients through a time of many unknowns.

Being compassionate is not the same as being empathetic although they are related. Empathy refers to our ability to feel the emotions of another person; compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help. 
-Listen with both your head and your heart.
-Show the patient that you care for their well-being as a person, not just their acute issue.
-Connect with a colleague to meet their needs or situation.  
-Listen to ensure that patients and families feel heard and seen, and that they are top priority.
