A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated. This is not designed to encourage yoga or mindfulness but rather to offer strategies that help people cope, which we all do differently. If you can’t sleep and feel the degree of anxiety you describe, maybe there are other types of intervention that might help you feel a little bit better while we all wait for the “real root” to get addressed? Please do think about accessing one of our live support resources.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,1

A: We do know that people with chronic lung conditions such as asthma may be at higher risk of more severe disease related to COVID-19 infection. As with all staff, I recommend you continue to follow closely our universal mask policy, perform frequent hand hygiene and cleaning of high touch surfaces including your phone, and follow all isolation and personal protective equipment guidelines if you care with patients with known or confirmed COVID-19. Everyone should be aware of any new symptoms such as cough or trouble breathing, or any other signs of infection such as fever, chills, malaise - and contact your doctor and manager right away if you develop any of these. I would also recommend discussing any chronic medical conditions with your doctor, as they can help work closely with occupational health and infection control to help determine if there are any additional modifications to your work assignments that are needed.",Kathleen Murphy,,1
