I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

Cultural Humility focuses on lifelong learning, self-reflection, removing power differentials (such as provider and patient) and demonstrating equal respect for different beliefs and points of view. The construct of cultural competence assumes that one can learn or know enough, that cultures are monolithic, and that one can reach a full understanding of a culture to which they do not belong.

In contrast, cultural humility encourages ongoing personal reflection and growth around culture in order to increase awareness and introspection. Cultural Humility is one of the core values of the Action for Cultural Transformation (ACT), a system-wide effort organized as a roadmap to eliminate structural racism across our institution. While we acknowledge that we cannot as individuals be competent in a culture other than our own, we can:

Work to reduce health disparities
Improve access to high-quality healthcare
Be respectful of and responsive to the needs of diverse patients

When we are committed to the practice of Cultural Humility, we can:

Create an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all
Improve patient care
Build a workplace that keeps and attracts high quality employees

-The practice of cultural humility involves viewing every encounter, be it with a patient or colleague, as a negotiation between two worldviews.
-Promoting an inclusive culture benefits not only those who work, train, study and/or advance science within our health system, but also those who seek care here and their family caregivers.
-When we value each other, it enhances our ability to care for our patients.

Cultural Humility is one of the behaviors that are essential for delivering the Penn Medicine Experience.

I coordinate Let’s Talk, Lancaster, a coalition of community partners dedicated to supporting mental health and wellness in our community. At one of our monthly workshops to advance trauma responsive practices, the facilitator took us through an exercise to help us reflect on our differences. We drew a circle on a piece of paper and then added a facial feature for every social connection we had with a person from a different background in our childhood.  

I looked down at the paper and saw one eye on an otherwise blank face. Seeing that image really struck me. I realized I can’t see what I haven’t lived.  

One way I can make a difference is to look at my sphere of influence, and make sure there are more seats at the table. Recently, we were reviewing a job description for a trauma-informed specialist position that required a bachelor’s degree, and I wondered if this degree was really needed for the work. After discussing it with the people who work closely with that position, we concluded that experience with trauma-informed care was just as important as having the degree.  

So we changed the job description to require either a bachelor’s degree or lived experience. That position could be filled by someone who may not have been considered before, who would bring a lot of experience into the room in addition to training. Someone who would help to broaden our lens as mental health care providers.
