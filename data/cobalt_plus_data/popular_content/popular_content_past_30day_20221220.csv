My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,9

I loved being one of the first people to greet patients and their families when they walked in the door. The way I saw it, my role was to help create an environment in which everyone feels welcome.  




 Several years later, I was able to apply my hospitality skills to a new role in Patient and Guest Relations, and I am still one of the first faces people see. As patient experience coordinator, I work closely with patients, providers, and administrators to ensure our patients get the best possible care. There are times when our patients don’t feel understood. I’m fortunate that in my role I get to listen to patients, find out what their needs are, and then communicate those needs to staff. Sometimes it’s as simple as going to get a breast pump for a new parent or working with a translator to discuss a patient’s options for care.  




Making people feel welcome is vital to establishing trust and providing equitable care. One way to build trust is to expand our connections in the community. Working alongside a team at PAH, I helped create a pathway program that partnered with two local charter schools. This year, we hired 10 high school graduates from the class of 2022 who are interested in health care careers and want to attend college using the UPHS tuition assistance benefit.  




The students rotate through multiple departments during their four-month paid internship. After the rotation ends, each student is matched with the department that’s the right fit for them and continues as full-time staff.  




 In addition to providing employment, we offer mentorship in the health care field. In one case, we had a patient services associate who wanted to become a phlebotomist. We paired her with the director of the laboratory so she could find out what classes to take and ask questions about the job she was pursuing.  




 The idea is to bring students in before they’ve made career choices and let them know what’s possible. It’s one small way to broaden our reach and help all who walk through our doors feel welcome.",Penn Medicine Experience,,5

 As occupational therapists (OTs), we remind people that they are whole, they are capable, and that we want them to get back to all the activities that allow them to feel like themselves again. One patient encounter really hit home this point and emphasized to me how important it is for us to be able to meet the needs of all the patients we see.  

I was doing rounds, and I was talking to a woman who was the patient of another OT. She pulled me aside and asked if I would be able to wash her hair, but I had to get to another patient. I went out into the hall and found a nurse whose hair was textured in a similar way to mine and the patient’s, and she said she would help wash her hair. As the three of us were talking and laughing together, I could just see the woman’s face change as she recognized we were going to help her, we understood her, and we had her back.  

 The subject of hair care had come up before, and the Rehabilitation staff acknowledged that we needed better tools for styling all textures of hair. My supervisor Natalia asked me for recommendations for styling tools that would work with textured hair.  

 Natalia later told me, “I never imagined how looking at the hair combs we have available could spark a larger conversation about culture and race in our profession.” On our floor, we’ve been talking a lot more about how we serve all the patients in our community, and what we can do to make everyone feel understood and valued. We are continuing to search for hair products that work for all populations.  

 A hair comb might seem like a small detail, but it can play a large role in getting a person back to feeling like themselves again. As OTs, that’s what we want most for our patients.",Penn Medicine Experience,,5

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand. That day with my patient, I recognized that how she felt about me as a person was more important than whether she agreed to start a new treatment in that moment.

A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated. This is not designed to encourage yoga or mindfulness but rather to offer strategies that help people cope, which we all do differently. If you can’t sleep and feel the degree of anxiety you describe, maybe there are other types of intervention that might help you feel a little bit better while we all wait for the “real root” to get addressed?

About two weeks later, the new mom arrived in the emergency room at Lancaster General Hospital (LGH) with a breast abscess. The attending physician recommended a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess, followed by antibiotics. After a brief conversation with the care team through an interpreter, she left the emergency room against the advice of the attending physician.  

 My name is Laurie Longenecker, and I’m a registered nurse in the Healthy Beginnings Plus program at LGH. We always work as a team to care for patients. Jen Snyder, Bethany Landgraff, and I collaborate to provide home health care, psychosocial and breastfeeding support, and many other services during home visits.  

As Jen puts it, “we learn so much about a person by visiting their home and learning about their life.” Before the baby was born, Jen spent a lot of time at the mother’s house helping her get the services she needed, including access to SNAP benefits to help feed her family.  

 Our team was notified about the mother’s emergency room visit. The next day at her home, I found her unable to sit up due to the pain in her breast. I knew that time was of the essence, but I also realized that I had to understand why she was resistant to treatment.  

 With the help of an interpreter, I carefully explained the recommended procedure. After a long conversation, the patient started to relax and seemed more open. She told me that when she first went to the emergency room, she thought the physician was saying she would have to have the whole breast removed. Now that I understood the new mom’s reservations, I was able to convince her to get the care she needed.  

 On a follow-up visit, Bethany discovered the patient hadn’t secured her course of antibiotics that were essential to her treatment. Bethany filled the prescription, helping to avoid another emergency room visit.  

 Jen, Bethany, and I continued to follow up with her for many weeks, often visiting her in her home. I’m happy to say that mom and baby are once again thriving. Bethany continues to follow up with our patient, providing lactation services and support for her and her infant. Our work is a team effort, for sure. They say it takes a village, and it really does.

One of my colleague, just return to work after being tested positive, he did 12 days of isolation. The management did not communicate anything about is return with the other employees. Even if they are following the recommendations, it will be wise to share such information with the others who are putting they life on the line. the employee who returned is young (23 years old), others are more older with preexisting health conditions. The fact is that, the recommendations from the CDC are changing periodically as we advance in the situation. None of the experts on COVID 19 have made a clear statement about immunity that one may get from the disease and how long it may last. Even, about re-infestation, there is not much information. Thus, we should inform employees when one of them is returning after being positive for COVID 19 (without violating HIPAA) in order for some of them to express their concern and maybe leave because they are in the high risk of the mortality for COVID 19. Those employee should be protected when they leave. This may help reduce the fatality rate that have been projected. Sincerely, Thank you.

A: The current CDC and PA Department recommendations for healthcare workers retuning to work if they have had COVID-19 are that people need to be at least 7 days from symptom onset, with improving symptoms, and no fevers for 72 hours (and have not taken any medications to reduce the fever). This is based on what we know at present about viral shedding and infectivity after infection. Our occupational health and infection control teams discuss in person with each person returning to work to ensure it is safe to do so. While we are learning about the disease, this is expert guidance on balancing what we know about infectivity and healthcare workers essential to the workforce and patient care. Our priority is the health and safety of our staff and we are closely monitoring any new information available. Our goal is also to protect the privacy of our staff, and so we work behind the scenes and through your manager to ensure you have the information that is necessary for your safety. Our universal masking policy is also designed to help protect you at work. If you have specific concerns about your health status or underlying conditions that may pre-dispose you to more severe disease, please discuss with occupational health - we can help give individual guidance.","Kathleen M Murphy, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases",,2

 We’re in Corporate Information Services (CORP IS), and we help design and manage the systems that allow our providers to do their work. Last fall, Penn Medicine partnered with Siemens to run a mobile mammography unit in North Philadelphia. We offered free mammograms to women who couldn’t easily visit a Penn Medicine facility, or who didn’t have health insurance. Getting the unit up and running required behind-the-scenes planning and coordination that few people saw, but that was essential to the success of the program.   

 Larry assembled a team from (CORP IS), including Steve and Tracy on the PennChart build, Jim on Clinical Imaging, and many others from Networking, Remote Sites Infrastructure, Desktop, and Enterprise User Desktop teams. Steve and Tracy built a workflow in PennChart, ensured that patients would not be billed for the free screenings, and assigned all patients to a clinical staff member to review their results. Jim collaborated with Siemens to create a plan to overcome the technical challenge of transmitting the radiology scans from the mobile unit to the Penn Medicine system where they would be reviewed by staff. Other team members came together to get the unit up and running and ready for patients.   

 Most of the people who came to us were walk-ups. One woman stopped by for a mammogram and then sent over several people from her church. Another woman in her 70s had her first baseline mammogram in the unit. She told us that she’d been scared to go to the doctor’s office for a mammogram in the past, but now she was relieved to get it done so easily, right in her neighborhood. She said she would tell her family members about breast cancer screenings and encourage them to get other preventive health care as well. We provided a total of 241 mammograms, with 78 percent having normal findings, and 22 percent needing additional imaging, which patients learned about in a call from a physician.   

 That’s why we do our work. It’s more than just the builds, and overcoming the technical challenges we face. It comes down to the result: helping our providers offer world-class care to patients who wouldn’t otherwise have access to it.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

I’m Lawrence Pratt, and my colleague Marchant Johnson and I are security guards at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC). Recently, a young man came into the hospital in police custody. He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.  

Sometimes when people see my uniform, I can tell from their body language that their defenses are up. What Marchant and I try to do is show that we’re fair and understanding.

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

I am pregnant (early in the second trimester) and very worried about working and contracting COVID-19. I have been trying to keep up to date on precautions for pregnant women and have been vigilant about hand washing and trying not to touch my face, get proper sleep/nutrition etc but I am scared for my baby. My pregnancy is considered high risk for other reasons and the only reassuring information I have seen comes from women who contracted the disease in their 3rd trimester and since I am only in the beginning of the second I am not sure what that means for my baby and me. I am also having a lot of anxiety thinking about needing to be in an ICU and what would happen to my baby. What if I am not able to be present for the birth or what if my baby gets sick too? What if I need to be separated from my baby after they are born? These thoughts bring me anxiety and sadness. I know my husband is also worried about me going to work and we are trying to stay safe but feel like this is out of our control. How can I best protect myself and my baby? Will someone advocate for me if I can't advocate for us?
A: We appreciate that working during this pandemic, particularly as we are still learning about the virus, can be very anxiety provoking and pregnant women have many important questions and concerns while navigating how to best protect themselves. I am attaching a FAQ for pregnant women that was developed in conjunction with OB/GYN, Pediatrics, and ID physicians at Penn and CHOP which can give you some further information.  I am also attaching Penn's guidance on working with COVID-19 infected patients for pregnant employees, and I would encourage you to have a dedicated discussion with your manager regarding your work environment and modifications made to keep you safe at this time. HR and Infection Control are also available to discuss with you at any time - and we really appreciate your dedication and want to keep you as safe as possible. Finally, if you're having trouble managing your anxiety, don't forget to consult the PennMedicineTogether website for the many resources now available to help you through it.

Currently I am being asked to take on new roles with which I have no prior experience and receiving no training or support. My past experiences with HR have been unhelpful. How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support. And as always, if you feel bullied and hence unsafe, SafetyNet remains an available resource to make your concerns known.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,1

I shared that I’m a cis-gender white woman, and I have biases that come from the privileges my identity provides me. I said that I speak about gender diversity from a position of empathy, with an understanding of the science, but without lived experience. This leaves me with blind spots and room for growth. I hoped that by being open about my own perspective, our providers would feel like it’s okay to not be an expert, and would be more open to learning.  


 I developed the Gender Talk series because I want to educate our providers about gender identity and empower them to create a gender-affirming environment at work for each other and for our patients. I also wanted to model how we can acknowledge the limits of our understanding about what our patients have experienced in their lives.  

 What our providers need, in addition to research-supported information, is to hear from someone with lived experience. We invited Jillian Celentano, a transgender patient advocate and social worker, to join us as one of our featured speakers.  

 As Jillian has said, “I emphasize how important it is to talk about pronouns, to use the right terminology when speaking to trans and nonbinary patients. That makes all the difference to us.” Jillian also answered specific questions from providers, and told them how essential medical and mental health providers are in the community. “We can’t do this journey without you, but we’re also scared,” she added. Jillian shared how making small but important changes around how we interact with trans and nonbinary patients can make them feel much more comfortable in the health care setting.  

After our first Gender Talk series, I made sure that we were making those small but important changes, like having pronouns on our badges, correcting patients’ armband text, and introducing ourselves using our pronouns. Recently, I was talking to a patient who was very ill and had survived violence based on their gender identity. The patient pulled me aside and told me they didn’t usually feel safe in hospitals, but that the interactions with our staff felt positive. This made it possible for the patient to feel safe and respected.  

 Making progress in this area is very meaningful to the trans and nonbinary community. These steps we’re taking will go a long way towards achieving health equity, where every person seeking care is acknowledged, respected, and understood.",Penn Medicine Experience,,1

I coordinate Let’s Talk, Lancaster, a coalition of community partners dedicated to supporting mental health and wellness in our community. At one of our monthly workshops to advance trauma responsive practices, the facilitator took us through an exercise to help us reflect on our differences. We drew a circle on a piece of paper and then added a facial feature for every social connection we had with a person from a different background in our childhood.  

I looked down at the paper and saw one eye on an otherwise blank face. Seeing that image really struck me. I realized I can’t see what I haven’t lived.  

One way I can make a difference is to look at my sphere of influence, and make sure there are more seats at the table. Recently, we were reviewing a job description for a trauma-informed specialist position that required a bachelor’s degree, and I wondered if this degree was really needed for the work. After discussing it with the people who work closely with that position, we concluded that experience with trauma-informed care was just as important as having the degree.  

So we changed the job description to require either a bachelor’s degree or lived experience. That position could be filled by someone who may not have been considered before, who would bring a lot of experience into the room in addition to training. Someone who would help to broaden our lens as mental health care providers.  

I recognize now that lived experience informs so much of how we relate to one another. My role in community health is to pass the microphone and listen.",Penn Medicine Experience,5.0,1

As a resident, I think it is very unsafe to be going in to speak and exam known covid positive patients with a surgical mask that is paper thin and for many of us, too large for our faces to the point where we feel air from the sides. As this is reported to be an airborne virus where particles remain in the air, I think it is unsafe and disrespectful to ask residents to take that risk when we have families at home who are prone to infection and are witnessing young patients like ourselves in the icu intubated. We have received emails about how many N95 donations we have received yet as the primary caretakers we are not seeing these masks and being told we are unable to obtain them when performing swabs, which per CDC guidelines is considered an aerosolizing procedure. I am overall disappointed and upset at the safety measures that have been put in place by penn medicine and hope that this is discussed in further detail. 


A: I appreciate your concerns about your safety while caring for COVID-19 patients. Based on the available data, we believe the virus is transmitted primarily through droplet route and contact of secretions with mucus membranes, with risk of airborne transmission only during aerosol generating procedures. In this setting, we are following the CDC and WHO guidance for contact, droplet, and eye protection during routine care of COVID-19 patients, and using respirators and PAPRs for aerosol generating procedures. We are prioritizing negative pressure rooms at present for critically ill patients and as many COVID patients as we can, and navigating increasing patient volumes. Our goal is to keep all of our staff safe, and provide respirators and PAPRs when the clinical situation necessitates risk of airborne transmission. We do not consider performing an NP swab to be an aerosol generating procedure based on available data, and feel that staff are safe performing this in gowns, gloves, face masks, and eye protection.  Face masks and eye protection will protect you from any droplet sized particles getting into your mouth, eyes, and nose.   We completely understand your concern about keeping your self and your family safe, and this is also our priority.  And we appreciate that our teams are working to take excellent care of our patients through a time of many unknowns.
