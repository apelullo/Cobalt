My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,25

 We’re in Corporate Information Services (CORP IS), and we help design and manage the systems that allow our providers to do their work. Last fall, Penn Medicine partnered with Siemens to run a mobile mammography unit in North Philadelphia. We offered free mammograms to women who couldn’t easily visit a Penn Medicine facility, or who didn’t have health insurance. Getting the unit up and running required behind-the-scenes planning and coordination that few people saw, but that was essential to the success of the program.   

 Larry assembled a team from (CORP IS), including Steve and Tracy on the PennChart build, Jim on Clinical Imaging, and many others from Networking, Remote Sites Infrastructure, Desktop, and Enterprise User Desktop teams. Steve and Tracy built a workflow in PennChart, ensured that patients would not be billed for the free screenings, and assigned all patients to a clinical staff member to review their results. Jim collaborated with Siemens to create a plan to overcome the technical challenge of transmitting the radiology scans from the mobile unit to the Penn Medicine system where they would be reviewed by staff. Other team members came together to get the unit up and running and ready for patients.   

 Most of the people who came to us were walk-ups. One woman stopped by for a mammogram and then sent over several people from her church. Another woman in her 70s had her first baseline mammogram in the unit. She told us that she’d been scared to go to the doctor’s office for a mammogram in the past, but now she was relieved to get it done so easily, right in her neighborhood. She said she would tell her family members about breast cancer screenings and encourage them to get other preventive health care as well. We provided a total of 241 mammograms, with 78 percent having normal findings, and 22 percent needing additional imaging, which patients learned about in a call from a physician.   

 That’s why we do our work. It’s more than just the builds, and overcoming the technical challenges we face. It comes down to the result: helping our providers offer world-class care to patients who wouldn’t otherwise have access to it.",Penn Medicine Experience,,12

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand.

About two weeks later, the new mom arrived in the emergency room at Lancaster General Hospital (LGH) with a breast abscess. The attending physician recommended a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess, followed by antibiotics. After a brief conversation with the care team through an interpreter, she left the emergency room against the advice of the attending physician.  

 My name is Laurie Longenecker, and I’m a registered nurse in the Healthy Beginnings Plus program at LGH. We always work as a team to care for patients. Jen Snyder, Bethany Landgraff, and I collaborate to provide home health care, psychosocial and breastfeeding support, and many other services during home visits.  

As Jen puts it, “we learn so much about a person by visiting their home and learning about their life.” Before the baby was born, Jen spent a lot of time at the mother’s house helping her get the services she needed, including access to SNAP benefits to help feed her family.  

 Our team was notified about the mother’s emergency room visit. The next day at her home, I found her unable to sit up due to the pain in her breast. I knew that time was of the essence, but I also realized that I had to understand why she was resistant to treatment.  

 With the help of an interpreter, I carefully explained the recommended procedure. After a long conversation, the patient started to relax and seemed more open. She told me that when she first went to the emergency room, she thought the physician was saying she would have to have the whole breast removed. Now that I understood the new mom’s reservations, I was able to convince her to get the care she needed.  

 On a follow-up visit, Bethany discovered the patient hadn’t secured her course of antibiotics that were essential to her treatment. Bethany filled the prescription, helping to avoid another emergency room visit.  

 Jen, Bethany, and I continued to follow up with her for many weeks, often visiting her in her home. I’m happy to say that mom and baby are once again thriving. Bethany continues to follow up with our patient, providing lactation services and support for her and her infant. Our work is a team effort, for sure.

In recent years, the practice of self-care has gained popularity as a strategy to cope with stress and to improve overall health. However, the current discourse often focuses on individual self-care behaviors and excludes systemic and community level factors that encourage, sustain, or inhibit self-care practices. This paper contextualizes a conceptual model of self-care with intersectionality theory and the psychology of liberation framework, in relation to the lived experiences of Black communities. The paper aims to underscore the necessity of self and community care as a tool for social justice, preservation, and resistance against oppressive systems that threaten the mental health and wellness of this community.",Janan P.

 As occupational therapists (OTs), we remind people that they are whole, they are capable, and that we want them to get back to all the activities that allow them to feel like themselves again. One patient encounter really hit home this point and emphasized to me how important it is for us to be able to meet the needs of all the patients we see.  

I was doing rounds, and I was talking to a woman who was the patient of another OT. She pulled me aside and asked if I would be able to wash her hair, but I had to get to another patient. I went out into the hall and found a nurse whose hair was textured in a similar way to mine and the patient’s, and she said she would help wash her hair. As the three of us were talking and laughing together, I could just see the woman’s face change as she recognized we were going to help her, we understood her, and we had her back.  

 The subject of hair care had come up before, and the Rehabilitation staff acknowledged that we needed better tools for styling all textures of hair. My supervisor Natalia asked me for recommendations for styling tools that would work with textured hair.  

 Natalia later told me, “I never imagined how looking at the hair combs we have available could spark a larger conversation about culture and race in our profession.” On our floor, we’ve been talking a lot more about how we serve all the patients in our community, and what we can do to make everyone feel understood and valued. We are continuing to search for hair products that work for all populations.  

 A hair comb might seem like a small detail, but it can play a large role in getting a person back to feeling like themselves again. As OTs, that’s what we want most for our patients.",Penn Medicine Experience,,4

I shared that I’m a cis-gender white woman, and I have biases that come from the privileges my identity provides me. I said that I speak about gender diversity from a position of empathy, with an understanding of the science, but without lived experience. This leaves me with blind spots and room for growth. I hoped that by being open about my own perspective, our providers would feel like it’s okay to not be an expert, and would be more open to learning.  


 I developed the Gender Talk series because I want to educate our providers about gender identity and empower them to create a gender-affirming environment at work for each other and for our patients. I also wanted to model how we can acknowledge the limits of our understanding about what our patients have experienced in their lives.  

 What our providers need, in addition to research-supported information, is to hear from someone with lived experience. We invited Jillian Celentano, a transgender patient advocate and social worker, to join us as one of our featured speakers.  

 As Jillian has said, “I emphasize how important it is to talk about pronouns, to use the right terminology when speaking to trans and nonbinary patients. That makes all the difference to us.” Jillian also answered specific questions from providers, and told them how essential medical and mental health providers are in the community. “We can’t do this journey without you, but we’re also scared,” she added. Jillian shared how making small but important changes around how we interact with trans and nonbinary patients can make them feel much more comfortable in the health care setting.  

After our first Gender Talk series, I made sure that we were making those small but important changes, like having pronouns on our badges, correcting patients’ armband text, and introducing ourselves using our pronouns. Recently, I was talking to a patient who was very ill and had survived violence based on their gender identity. The patient pulled me aside and told me they didn’t usually feel safe in hospitals, but that the interactions with our staff felt positive. This made it possible for the patient to feel safe and respected.  

 Making progress in this area is very meaningful to the trans and nonbinary community. These steps we’re taking will go a long way towards achieving health equity, where every person seeking care is acknowledged, respected, and understood.",Penn Medicine Experience,,3

One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them.

A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated.

I loved being one of the first people to greet patients and their families when they walked in the door. The way I saw it, my role was to help create an environment in which everyone feels welcome.  




 Several years later, I was able to apply my hospitality skills to a new role in Patient and Guest Relations, and I am still one of the first faces people see. As patient experience coordinator, I work closely with patients, providers, and administrators to ensure our patients get the best possible care. There are times when our patients don’t feel understood. I’m fortunate that in my role I get to listen to patients, find out what their needs are, and then communicate those needs to staff. Sometimes it’s as simple as going to get a breast pump for a new parent or working with a translator to discuss a patient’s options for care.  




Making people feel welcome is vital to establishing trust and providing equitable care. One way to build trust is to expand our connections in the community. Working alongside a team at PAH, I helped create a pathway program that partnered with two local charter schools. This year, we hired 10 high school graduates from the class of 2022 who are interested in health care careers and want to attend college using the UPHS tuition assistance benefit.  




The students rotate through multiple departments during their four-month paid internship. After the rotation ends, each student is matched with the department that’s the right fit for them and continues as full-time staff.  




 In addition to providing employment, we offer mentorship in the health care field. In one case, we had a patient services associate who wanted to become a phlebotomist. We paired her with the director of the laboratory so she could find out what classes to take and ask questions about the job she was pursuing.

Our biobank technician Gabriella had been working with us for just under a year when I asked her to review the interview questions for an upcoming round of hires.  

“I noticed that while the questions were relevant to the work we do in the lab, none of them asked the applicant to share their experiences working with people who are different from themselves, which is critical to how we get our work done here in the lab,” Gabriella told me. So, Gabriella and I workshopped three new questions that focused on lived experiences and the ability to work well with people from different backgrounds.  

We hope our enhanced interview questions will give applicants a better understanding of what we stand for here in the lab. As Gabriella put it, “everyone deserves to feel seen, heard, and respected in the workplace, and that should start with the interview process.”  

The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Candidates tell us they’re not used to being asked those kinds of questions, but they see the value. For our part, we’ve learned a lot about the candidates from their answers to those questions that we never would have known otherwise.  

Gabriella is headed towards medical school, and I’m sorry to have her go, but eager to see all she can accomplish in this field. She brings with her the tenacity to stick with a problem until she can find a solution, and deep empathy for our patients. Gabriella credits her work at Penn Medicine as a major reason for continuing her studies. “I’ve been inspired by the dedication and expertise of the Penn Medicine physicians that I’ve worked with over the past year.”

I hope the small changes we made to the interview questions will demonstrate how important it is to bring many different perspectives into play—in hiring as well as in our day-to-day interactions at work.",Penn Medicine Experience,8.0,1

 I’m a registered nurse and certified breastfeeding consultant, and I’ve been working at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) for 33 years. I’m at the bedside with parents and their newborns from after delivery until they leave the hospital. During that time, I get to teach them how to swaddle their baby, put the first diaper on, figure out the feeding, and settle into parenthood. I enjoy seeing those “aha!” moments as parents learn how to care for their babies.  




 Recently, I had a patient and her husband who were staring at my ID badge when I first came into the room. They said they’d already seen the doctor and they wanted to see a different lactation consultant than me. I told them I’d be here all day. I left my phone number, and then I walked out the door. I took a deep breath.  




When I told a white colleague on the floor about this, she went to talk to them. She explained that I’m a very experienced certified breastfeeding consultant, and she suggested they try working with me. A few minutes later, the patient asked me to come back, and I worked with her and her family until the end of my shift. Their whole attitude changed as we talked, and I helped them overcome some feeding challenges and answered several other questions they had.  




It’s not the first time that’s happened, nor will it be the last. But I know the best thing I can do in those situations is to step away, and then work with them when they’re ready. I ask open-ended questions, I try not to judge, and I remember that everyone is shaped by their own experiences. I also know my colleagues have my back and will educate patients when needed.  




 That support comes from leadership as well—they encourage us to speak up when something isn’t right. Soon after the civil unrest in 2020, hospital leadership encouraged us to talk about our lived experiences as people of color. I started speaking up and sharing concerns that I had—like my experience with the patient and her husband who didn’t want to engage with me at first. I’m honored to serve as the chair of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Core Council at HUP. I see positive change coming out of our work. In our focus group series, people from across our hospital system gather to talk about racism and other forms of discrimination, without judgment.  




 It might be awkward or stressful sometimes, but it’s so important to have these conversations, and to learn from each other. That’s what our leadership is empowering us to do. I believe this work can help us all improve in our roles, ultimately allowing us to deliver the best possible care to our patients and their families.",Penn Medicine Experience,0.0,1

I coordinate Let’s Talk, Lancaster, a coalition of community partners dedicated to supporting mental health and wellness in our community. At one of our monthly workshops to advance trauma responsive practices, the facilitator took us through an exercise to help us reflect on our differences. We drew a circle on a piece of paper and then added a facial feature for every social connection we had with a person from a different background in our childhood.  

I looked down at the paper and saw one eye on an otherwise blank face. Seeing that image really struck me. I realized I can’t see what I haven’t lived.  

One way I can make a difference is to look at my sphere of influence, and make sure there are more seats at the table. Recently, we were reviewing a job description for a trauma-informed specialist position that required a bachelor’s degree, and I wondered if this degree was really needed for the work. After discussing it with the people who work closely with that position, we concluded that experience with trauma-informed care was just as important as having the degree.  

So we changed the job description to require either a bachelor’s degree or lived experience. That position could be filled by someone who may not have been considered before, who would bring a lot of experience into the room in addition to training. Someone who would help to broaden our lens as mental health care providers.

Cultural Humility focuses on lifelong learning, self-reflection, removing power differentials (such as provider and patient) and demonstrating equal respect for different beliefs and points of view. The construct of cultural competence assumes that one can learn or know enough, that cultures are monolithic, and that one can reach a full understanding of a culture to which they do not belong.

In contrast, cultural humility encourages ongoing personal reflection and growth around culture in order to increase awareness and introspection. Cultural Humility is one of the core values of the Action for Cultural Transformation (ACT), a system-wide effort organized as a roadmap to eliminate structural racism across our institution. While we acknowledge that we cannot as individuals be competent in a culture other than our own, we can:

Work to reduce health disparities
Improve access to high-quality healthcare
Be respectful of and responsive to the needs of diverse patients

When we are committed to the practice of Cultural Humility, we can:

Create an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all
Improve patient care
Build a workplace that keeps and attracts high quality employees

-The practice of cultural humility involves viewing every encounter, be it with a patient or colleague, as a negotiation between two worldviews.
-Promoting an inclusive culture benefits not only those who work, train, study and/or advance science within our health system, but also those who seek care here and their family caregivers.
-When we value each other, it enhances our ability to care for our patients.
