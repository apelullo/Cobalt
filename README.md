# Cobalt
Cobalt is a mental health and wellness platform created for Penn Medicine employees that serves as a hub for support services such as therapy, wellness coaching, topic- and population-specific group sessions, and a variety of self-help resources. I was responsible for site-wide data validation, desigining experiments, and implementing targeted analyses to facilitate the ongoing development of key business metrics that characterize user behavior in content engagement, service utilization, and treatment outcomes. I worked with a cross-functional team of developers, project and product managers, researchers, and healthcare professionals to communicate findings that informed strategic decisions and identified future needs to ensure the long-term success of the platform.
