Individual contributors working together and/or with their managers/supervisors to achieve the team's objectives. 
Individuals with specialty areas of expertise working together to develop a patient treatment plan.
Individuals from different parts of the organization working together to achieve a larger goal for the health system. While teamwork is often a union of two people or a group to accomplish a task, being collaborative includes:

Brainstorming ideas and solutions
Creating a strong sense of purpose
Engaging equal participation of all parties

Examples of Collaboration are as follows:
-Inter-professional teams taking care of a medically complex patient
-Information Technology (IT) Analysts optimizing system use with clinicians
-Ambulatory practice leaders reviewing patient access trends with Marketing colleagues

Collaborative is one of the behaviors that are essential for delivering the Penn Medicine Experience. 
Focusing on these competencies is beneficial to patients because the healthcare team can work effectively together to decide on the best treatment option. 
These competencies are beneficial to coworkers and the organization because being collaborative and communicating effectively are the foundation of driving innovative solutions.

My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand. That day with my patient, I recognized that how she felt about me as a person was more important than whether she agreed to start a new treatment in that moment.
