I loved being one of the first people to greet patients and their families when they walked in the door. The way I saw it, my role was to help create an environment in which everyone feels welcome.  




 Several years later, I was able to apply my hospitality skills to a new role in Patient and Guest Relations, and I am still one of the first faces people see. As patient experience coordinator, I work closely with patients, providers, and administrators to ensure our patients get the best possible care. There are times when our patients don’t feel understood. I’m fortunate that in my role I get to listen to patients, find out what their needs are, and then communicate those needs to staff. Sometimes it’s as simple as going to get a breast pump for a new parent or working with a translator to discuss a patient’s options for care.  




Making people feel welcome is vital to establishing trust and providing equitable care. One way to build trust is to expand our connections in the community. Working alongside a team at PAH, I helped create a pathway program that partnered with two local charter schools. This year, we hired 10 high school graduates from the class of 2022 who are interested in health care careers and want to attend college using the UPHS tuition assistance benefit.  




The students rotate through multiple departments during their four-month paid internship. After the rotation ends, each student is matched with the department that’s the right fit for them and continues as full-time staff.  




 In addition to providing employment, we offer mentorship in the health care field. In one case, we had a patient services associate who wanted to become a phlebotomist. We paired her with the director of the laboratory so she could find out what classes to take and ask questions about the job she was pursuing.  




 The idea is to bring students in before they’ve made career choices and let them know what’s possible. It’s one small way to broaden our reach and help all who walk through our doors feel welcome.",Penn Medicine Experience,,4

I’m Lawrence Pratt, and my colleague Marchant Johnson and I are security guards at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC). Recently, a young man came into the hospital in police custody. He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.  

Sometimes when people see my uniform, I can tell from their body language that their defenses are up. What Marchant and I try to do is show that we’re fair and understanding. We want to find out what that person needs, and how we can help them. I tell people that in order to get what you want; you may have to bend a little so that you can get what you need.  

Everyone is different, and everyone needs to be treated with respect and dignity. Marchant and I like to approach our work with kindness and an open mind. It allows us to connect to people, gain their trust, and help them get the care that they need.",Penn Medicine Experience,4.0,2

 As a social worker in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN), I serve the whole family: the baby, the birth parent, and any other parents or loved ones who are involved in the baby’s care. One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them. So, I wrote “mama” for each parent in the baby’s chart and in the birth parent’s chart. I made sure all my colleagues were using the correct terms to refer to the parents.   

As the family was leaving the hospital, the parents told me how much they appreciated being asked what they wanted to be called. I want all my patients to feel that I hear and care about them. I want their visit to feel as positive as possible, so they know they can come back, and they’ll feel comfortable that their care team is looking out for them.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

About two weeks later, the new mom arrived in the emergency room at Lancaster General Hospital (LGH) with a breast abscess. The attending physician recommended a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess, followed by antibiotics. After a brief conversation with the care team through an interpreter, she left the emergency room against the advice of the attending physician.  

 My name is Laurie Longenecker, and I’m a registered nurse in the Healthy Beginnings Plus program at LGH. We always work as a team to care for patients. Jen Snyder, Bethany Landgraff, and I collaborate to provide home health care, psychosocial and breastfeeding support, and many other services during home visits.  

As Jen puts it, “we learn so much about a person by visiting their home and learning about their life.” Before the baby was born, Jen spent a lot of time at the mother’s house helping her get the services she needed, including access to SNAP benefits to help feed her family.  

 Our team was notified about the mother’s emergency room visit. The next day at her home, I found her unable to sit up due to the pain in her breast. I knew that time was of the essence, but I also realized that I had to understand why she was resistant to treatment.  

 With the help of an interpreter, I carefully explained the recommended procedure. After a long conversation, the patient started to relax and seemed more open. She told me that when she first went to the emergency room, she thought the physician was saying she would have to have the whole breast removed. Now that I understood the new mom’s reservations, I was able to convince her to get the care she needed.  

 On a follow-up visit, Bethany discovered the patient hadn’t secured her course of antibiotics that were essential to her treatment. Bethany filled the prescription, helping to avoid another emergency room visit.  

 Jen, Bethany, and I continued to follow up with her for many weeks, often visiting her in her home. I’m happy to say that mom and baby are once again thriving. Bethany continues to follow up with our patient, providing lactation services and support for her and her infant. Our work is a team effort, for sure. They say it takes a village, and it really does.
