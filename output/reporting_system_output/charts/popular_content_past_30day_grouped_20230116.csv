My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,7

We are also wearing surgical masks and reusing them (so far, same mask for almost 2 weeks). Meanwhile, some who are not performing direct care are walking around in N95s. We understand that what is recommended is that one surgical mask be reused until visibly soiled or damaged. It is very frustrating to not hear the hospital just admit that reusing surgical masks for 2 weeks is completely inappropriate in any scenario. It may be NECESSARY because of shortages, but it's being phrased as if we have nothing to worry about by reusing single use masks. We are health care providers who are trained to know that this is untrue! When COVID-19 ""calms down,"" and we are back to ""regular"" supply use, it will again be seen as completely inappropriate to reuse PPE. Why is there no acknowledgement of this fact now? If it's what we have to do because of shortages, fine, but there is no need to tell us that a 2 week old mask is appropriate protection unless we are intubating or suctioning. We literally just completed a Knowledge Link on this topic within the last few months.   In addition, our patients cannot be isolated or quarantined in house, and those who are showing symptoms cannot be forced to wear masks, though we do encourage adherence as much as possible. While we understand the need for available psychiatric treatment, I think we expect a better explanation of why we continue to admit voluntary patients who are febrile, coughing, and not tested!   We feel voiceless and disposable. It seems like every concern brought up is met with vague acknowledgement but no answers, and while we understand that there are many unknowns, the lack of transparency is causing irreparable distrust.

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed.

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand.

I followed the process and they said it was accepted and that he would receive confirmation if a bed was available. That was a week ago and he has since worked his 4 days. There are obviously not enough beds for healthy health care workers in that one location. What is penn medicine doing to accommodate more? Many hotel chains are empty. Are we getting more for us?
A: Hello, here's what we received from Jen Brady, Associate Director, Employee Benefits and Wellness:

At this point there are two options for employees. There are free rooms are available for Philadelphia staff at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in University City and Sheraton Philadelphia University City Hotel for healthcare workers who wish to stay close to work during this time. Free accommodations are based upon room availability and policies are subject to change. The leadership is continuing to monitor occupancy and assess needs of employees.

One of my colleague, just return to work after being tested positive, he did 12 days of isolation. The management did not communicate anything about is return with the other employees. Even if they are following the recommendations, it will be wise to share such information with the others who are putting they life on the line. the employee who returned is young (23 years old), others are more older with preexisting health conditions. The fact is that, the recommendations from the CDC are changing periodically as we advance in the situation. None of the experts on COVID 19 have made a clear statement about immunity that one may get from the disease and how long it may last. Even, about re-infestation, there is not much information. Thus, we should inform employees when one of them is returning after being positive for COVID 19 (without violating HIPAA) in order for some of them to express their concern and maybe leave because they are in the high risk of the mortality for COVID 19. Those employee should be protected when they leave. This may help reduce the fatality rate that have been projected. Sincerely, Thank you.

A: The current CDC and PA Department recommendations for healthcare workers retuning to work if they have had COVID-19 are that people need to be at least 7 days from symptom onset, with improving symptoms, and no fevers for 72 hours (and have not taken any medications to reduce the fever). This is based on what we know at present about viral shedding and infectivity after infection. Our occupational health and infection control teams discuss in person with each person returning to work to ensure it is safe to do so. While we are learning about the disease, this is expert guidance on balancing what we know about infectivity and healthcare workers essential to the workforce and patient care. Our priority is the health and safety of our staff and we are closely monitoring any new information available. Our goal is also to protect the privacy of our staff, and so we work behind the scenes and through your manager to ensure you have the information that is necessary for your safety. Our universal masking policy is also designed to help protect you at work. If you have specific concerns about your health status or underlying conditions that may pre-dispose you to more severe disease, please discuss with occupational health - we can help give individual guidance.","Kathleen M Murphy, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases",,1

They are the ones holding a woman’s hand and providing emotional support during labor. They are the ones changing dressings and swapping out bedpans. They are the ones comforting family members during a loved one’s health battles. This also means they are often the target of patient violence.

Healthcare employees, particularly nurses, are at an increased risk for workplace violence. Earlier this month, we covered some of the statistics on workplace violence in healthcare, including the fact that from 2002 to 2013, incidents of serious workplace violence (those requiring days off for the injured) were four times more common in healthcare than in the overall private industry.

Since this issue isn’t going away, nurses must prepare themselves for the possibility of workplace violence through education and training.",Workplaces Respond to Domestic and Sexual Violence: A National Resource Center (Workplaces Respond),,1

Cultural Humility focuses on lifelong learning, self-reflection, removing power differentials (such as provider and patient) and demonstrating equal respect for different beliefs and points of view. The construct of cultural competence assumes that one can learn or know enough, that cultures are monolithic, and that one can reach a full understanding of a culture to which they do not belong.

In contrast, cultural humility encourages ongoing personal reflection and growth around culture in order to increase awareness and introspection. Cultural Humility is one of the core values of the Action for Cultural Transformation (ACT), a system-wide effort organized as a roadmap to eliminate structural racism across our institution. While we acknowledge that we cannot as individuals be competent in a culture other than our own, we can:

Work to reduce health disparities
Improve access to high-quality healthcare
Be respectful of and responsive to the needs of diverse patients

When we are committed to the practice of Cultural Humility, we can:

Create an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all
Improve patient care
Build a workplace that keeps and attracts high quality employees

-The practice of cultural humility involves viewing every encounter, be it with a patient or colleague, as a negotiation between two worldviews.
-Promoting an inclusive culture benefits not only those who work, train, study and/or advance science within our health system, but also those who seek care here and their family caregivers.
-When we value each other, it enhances our ability to care for our patients.

Cultural Humility is one of the behaviors that are essential for delivering the Penn Medicine Experience.
