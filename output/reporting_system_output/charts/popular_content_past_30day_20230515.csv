Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand. That day with my patient, I recognized that how she felt about me as a person was more important than whether she agreed to start a new treatment in that moment.

He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.
