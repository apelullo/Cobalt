If we are lucky, when we stumble into bed at night, we might have crossed off a handful of tasks. We have trouble sleeping as we think about all of the things we failed to do. For some reason, in the middle of the night, the size of these tasks is exaggerated. When we get up the next day, we are sleep deprived and racked with guilt, ready to begin yet another day of being behind. This vicious cycle goes on day after day, month after month, year after year. In this age of 24/7 connectivity, if we take a “vacation,” we continue to do work, and if we don't, we feel guilty. The fatigue, disorganization, and sense of loss of control usually leads to reduced productivity and quality of our efforts, both professional and personal. The stress and anxiety take up valuable time and energy. Anxiety eats brainpower. How do we break this cycle? Learning to manage our time, instead of allowing time to manage us, is the key.</p>",Journal of the American College of Radiology,10.0,1

While they may be reluctant to open up or they may become defensive, there are ways to approach the conversation which can increase the chances that it will go well.

It ensures that each of us take responsibility for the service we deliver and when problems occur, we accept responsibility and make it right. We are accountable when we:

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed. Take responsibility for the outcomes of the projects and tasks performed individually, as well as team projects and tasks. Set goals, track progress and hold others accountable for completion of tasks and projects. Provide honest, direct and balanced feedback to others on performance and impact.

Being accountable is critical to delivering the Penn Medicine Experience for our patients and for each other.
Focus on ""Ensuring Accountability,"" and take ownership of problems using a solution-oriented approach to overcome challenges.
