She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,10

We are also wearing surgical masks and reusing them (so far, same mask for almost 2 weeks). Meanwhile, some who are not performing direct care are walking around in N95s. We understand that what is recommended is that one surgical mask be reused until visibly soiled or damaged. It is very frustrating to not hear the hospital just admit that reusing surgical masks for 2 weeks is completely inappropriate in any scenario. It may be NECESSARY because of shortages, but it's being phrased as if we have nothing to worry about by reusing single use masks. We are health care providers who are trained to know that this is untrue! When COVID-19 ""calms down,"" and we are back to ""regular"" supply use, it will again be seen as completely inappropriate to reuse PPE. Why is there no acknowledgement of this fact now? If it's what we have to do because of shortages, fine, but there is no need to tell us that a 2 week old mask is appropriate protection unless we are intubating or suctioning. We literally just completed a Knowledge Link on this topic within the last few months.   In addition, our patients cannot be isolated or quarantined in house, and those who are showing symptoms cannot be forced to wear masks, though we do encourage adherence as much as possible. While we understand the need for available psychiatric treatment, I think we expect a better explanation of why we continue to admit voluntary patients who are febrile, coughing, and not tested!   We feel voiceless and disposable. It seems like every concern brought up is met with vague acknowledgement but no answers, and while we understand that there are many unknowns, the lack of transparency is causing irreparable distrust.

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

About two weeks later, the new mom arrived in the emergency room at Lancaster General Hospital (LGH) with a breast abscess. The attending physician recommended a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess, followed by antibiotics. After a brief conversation with the care team through an interpreter, she left the emergency room against the advice of the attending physician.  

 My name is Laurie Longenecker, and I’m a registered nurse in the Healthy Beginnings Plus program at LGH. We always work as a team to care for patients. Jen Snyder, Bethany Landgraff, and I collaborate to provide home health care, psychosocial and breastfeeding support, and many other services during home visits.  

As Jen puts it, “we learn so much about a person by visiting their home and learning about their life.” Before the baby was born, Jen spent a lot of time at the mother’s house helping her get the services she needed, including access to SNAP benefits to help feed her family.  

 Our team was notified about the mother’s emergency room visit. The next day at her home, I found her unable to sit up due to the pain in her breast. I knew that time was of the essence, but I also realized that I had to understand why she was resistant to treatment.  

 With the help of an interpreter, I carefully explained the recommended procedure. After a long conversation, the patient started to relax and seemed more open. She told me that when she first went to the emergency room, she thought the physician was saying she would have to have the whole breast removed. Now that I understood the new mom’s reservations, I was able to convince her to get the care she needed.  

 On a follow-up visit, Bethany discovered the patient hadn’t secured her course of antibiotics that were essential to her treatment. Bethany filled the prescription, helping to avoid another emergency room visit.  

 Jen, Bethany, and I continued to follow up with her for many weeks, often visiting her in her home. I’m happy to say that mom and baby are once again thriving. Bethany continues to follow up with our patient, providing lactation services and support for her and her infant. Our work is a team effort, for sure. They say it takes a village, and it really does.  

 We love working with parents, being welcomed into their homes, and learning about their lives. Ultimately, they are the experts on their own bodies and on their families.

I loved being one of the first people to greet patients and their families when they walked in the door. The way I saw it, my role was to help create an environment in which everyone feels welcome.  




 Several years later, I was able to apply my hospitality skills to a new role in Patient and Guest Relations, and I am still one of the first faces people see. As patient experience coordinator, I work closely with patients, providers, and administrators to ensure our patients get the best possible care. There are times when our patients don’t feel understood. I’m fortunate that in my role I get to listen to patients, find out what their needs are, and then communicate those needs to staff. Sometimes it’s as simple as going to get a breast pump for a new parent or working with a translator to discuss a patient’s options for care.  




Making people feel welcome is vital to establishing trust and providing equitable care. One way to build trust is to expand our connections in the community. Working alongside a team at PAH, I helped create a pathway program that partnered with two local charter schools. This year, we hired 10 high school graduates from the class of 2022 who are interested in health care careers and want to attend college using the UPHS tuition assistance benefit.  




The students rotate through multiple departments during their four-month paid internship. After the rotation ends, each student is matched with the department that’s the right fit for them and continues as full-time staff.  




 In addition to providing employment, we offer mentorship in the health care field. In one case, we had a patient services associate who wanted to become a phlebotomist. We paired her with the director of the laboratory so she could find out what classes to take and ask questions about the job she was pursuing.  




 The idea is to bring students in before they’ve made career choices and let them know what’s possible. It’s one small way to broaden our reach and help all who walk through our doors feel welcome.",Penn Medicine Experience,,1

How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support. And as always, if you feel bullied and hence unsafe, SafetyNet remains an available resource to make your concerns known.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,1

I have been trying to keep up to date on precautions for pregnant women and have been vigilant about hand washing and trying not to touch my face, get proper sleep/nutrition etc but I am scared for my baby. My pregnancy is considered high risk for other reasons and the only reassuring information I have seen comes from women who contracted the disease in their 3rd trimester and since I am only in the beginning of the second I am not sure what that means for my baby and me. I am also having a lot of anxiety thinking about needing to be in an ICU and what would happen to my baby. What if I am not able to be present for the birth or what if my baby gets sick too? What if I need to be separated from my baby after they are born? These thoughts bring me anxiety and sadness.

One of my colleague, just return to work after being tested positive, he did 12 days of isolation. The management did not communicate anything about is return with the other employees. Even if they are following the recommendations, it will be wise to share such information with the others who are putting they life on the line. the employee who returned is young (23 years old), others are more older with preexisting health conditions. The fact is that, the recommendations from the CDC are changing periodically as we advance in the situation. None of the experts on COVID 19 have made a clear statement about immunity that one may get from the disease and how long it may last. Even, about re-infestation, there is not much information. Thus, we should inform employees when one of them is returning after being positive for COVID 19 (without violating HIPAA) in order for some of them to express their concern and maybe leave because they are in the high risk of the mortality for COVID 19. Those employee should be protected when they leave. This may help reduce the fatality rate that have been projected. Sincerely, Thank you.

A: The current CDC and PA Department recommendations for healthcare workers retuning to work if they have had COVID-19 are that people need to be at least 7 days from symptom onset, with improving symptoms, and no fevers for 72 hours (and have not taken any medications to reduce the fever). This is based on what we know at present about viral shedding and infectivity after infection. Our occupational health and infection control teams discuss in person with each person returning to work to ensure it is safe to do so. While we are learning about the disease, this is expert guidance on balancing what we know about infectivity and healthcare workers essential to the workforce and patient care. Our priority is the health and safety of our staff and we are closely monitoring any new information available. Our goal is also to protect the privacy of our staff, and so we work behind the scenes and through your manager to ensure you have the information that is necessary for your safety.

A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated. This is not designed to encourage yoga or mindfulness but rather to offer strategies that help people cope, which we all do differently.

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed. Take responsibility for the outcomes of the projects and tasks performed individually, as well as team projects and tasks. Set goals, track progress and hold others accountable for completion of tasks and projects. Provide honest, direct and balanced feedback to others on performance and impact.

I coordinate Let’s Talk, Lancaster, a coalition of community partners dedicated to supporting mental health and wellness in our community. At one of our monthly workshops to advance trauma responsive practices, the facilitator took us through an exercise to help us reflect on our differences. We drew a circle on a piece of paper and then added a facial feature for every social connection we had with a person from a different background in our childhood.  

I looked down at the paper and saw one eye on an otherwise blank face. Seeing that image really struck me. I realized I can’t see what I haven’t lived.  

One way I can make a difference is to look at my sphere of influence, and make sure there are more seats at the table. Recently, we were reviewing a job description for a trauma-informed specialist position that required a bachelor’s degree, and I wondered if this degree was really needed for the work. After discussing it with the people who work closely with that position, we concluded that experience with trauma-informed care was just as important as having the degree.  

So we changed the job description to require either a bachelor’s degree or lived experience. That position could be filled by someone who may not have been considered before, who would bring a lot of experience into the room in addition to training. Someone who would help to broaden our lens as mental health care providers.

Cultural Humility focuses on lifelong learning, self-reflection, removing power differentials (such as provider and patient) and demonstrating equal respect for different beliefs and points of view. The construct of cultural competence assumes that one can learn or know enough, that cultures are monolithic, and that one can reach a full understanding of a culture to which they do not belong.

In contrast, cultural humility encourages ongoing personal reflection and growth around culture in order to increase awareness and introspection. Cultural Humility is one of the core values of the Action for Cultural Transformation (ACT), a system-wide effort organized as a roadmap to eliminate structural racism across our institution. While we acknowledge that we cannot as individuals be competent in a culture other than our own, we can:

Work to reduce health disparities
Improve access to high-quality healthcare
Be respectful of and responsive to the needs of diverse patients

When we are committed to the practice of Cultural Humility, we can:

Create an inclusive, diverse and equitable environment for all
Improve patient care
Build a workplace that keeps and attracts high quality employees

-The practice of cultural humility involves viewing every encounter, be it with a patient or colleague, as a negotiation between two worldviews.
-Promoting an inclusive culture benefits not only those who work, train, study and/or advance science within our health system, but also those who seek care here and their family caregivers.
-When we value each other, it enhances our ability to care for our patients.

Cultural Humility is one of the behaviors that are essential for delivering the Penn Medicine Experience.

He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.  

Sometimes when people see my uniform, I can tell from their body language that their defenses are up. What Marchant and I try to do is show that we’re fair and understanding.
