Currently I am being asked to take on new roles with which I have no prior experience and receiving no training or support. My past experiences with HR have been unhelpful. How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support. And as always, if you feel bullied and hence unsafe, SafetyNet remains an available resource to make your concerns known.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,2

I shared that I’m a cis-gender white woman, and I have biases that come from the privileges my identity provides me. I said that I speak about gender diversity from a position of empathy, with an understanding of the science, but without lived experience. This leaves me with blind spots and room for growth. I hoped that by being open about my own perspective, our providers would feel like it’s okay to not be an expert, and would be more open to learning.  


 I developed the Gender Talk series because I want to educate our providers about gender identity and empower them to create a gender-affirming environment at work for each other and for our patients. I also wanted to model how we can acknowledge the limits of our understanding about what our patients have experienced in their lives.  

 What our providers need, in addition to research-supported information, is to hear from someone with lived experience. We invited Jillian Celentano, a transgender patient advocate and social worker, to join us as one of our featured speakers.  

 As Jillian has said, “I emphasize how important it is to talk about pronouns, to use the right terminology when speaking to trans and nonbinary patients. That makes all the difference to us.” Jillian also answered specific questions from providers, and told them how essential medical and mental health providers are in the community. “We can’t do this journey without you, but we’re also scared,” she added. Jillian shared how making small but important changes around how we interact with trans and nonbinary patients can make them feel much more comfortable in the health care setting.  

After our first Gender Talk series, I made sure that we were making those small but important changes, like having pronouns on our badges, correcting patients’ armband text, and introducing ourselves using our pronouns. Recently, I was talking to a patient who was very ill and had survived violence based on their gender identity. The patient pulled me aside and told me they didn’t usually feel safe in hospitals, but that the interactions with our staff felt positive. This made it possible for the patient to feel safe and respected.  

 Making progress in this area is very meaningful to the trans and nonbinary community. These steps we’re taking will go a long way towards achieving health equity, where every person seeking care is acknowledged, respected, and understood.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.
