My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,5

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand. That day with my patient, I recognized that how she felt about me as a person was more important than whether she agreed to start a new treatment in that moment.

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support.

We are also wearing surgical masks and reusing them (so far, same mask for almost 2 weeks). Meanwhile, some who are not performing direct care are walking around in N95s. We understand that what is recommended is that one surgical mask be reused until visibly soiled or damaged. It is very frustrating to not hear the hospital just admit that reusing surgical masks for 2 weeks is completely inappropriate in any scenario. It may be NECESSARY because of shortages, but it's being phrased as if we have nothing to worry about by reusing single use masks. We are health care providers who are trained to know that this is untrue! When COVID-19 ""calms down,"" and we are back to ""regular"" supply use, it will again be seen as completely inappropriate to reuse PPE. Why is there no acknowledgement of this fact now? If it's what we have to do because of shortages, fine, but there is no need to tell us that a 2 week old mask is appropriate protection unless we are intubating or suctioning. We literally just completed a Knowledge Link on this topic within the last few months.   In addition, our patients cannot be isolated or quarantined in house, and those who are showing symptoms cannot be forced to wear masks, though we do encourage adherence as much as possible. While we understand the need for available psychiatric treatment, I think we expect a better explanation of why we continue to admit voluntary patients who are febrile, coughing, and not tested!   We feel voiceless and disposable. It seems like every concern brought up is met with vague acknowledgement but no answers, and while we understand that there are many unknowns, the lack of transparency is causing irreparable distrust.

It ensures that each of us take responsibility for the service we deliver and when problems occur, we accept responsibility and make it right. We are accountable when we:

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed. Take responsibility for the outcomes of the projects and tasks performed individually, as well as team projects and tasks. Set goals, track progress and hold others accountable for completion of tasks and projects. Provide honest, direct and balanced feedback to others on performance and impact.

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.

Try sitting in a way that’s both relaxed and alert at the same time with both feet on the floor and hands resting on your thighs. When you’re in a stable position it helps to create stability in the mind as well. This practice allows you to focus on the sensation of breathing rather than the breaths you’re taking.,Simcha Zevit,7.0,1

 As a social worker in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN), I serve the whole family: the baby, the birth parent, and any other parents or loved ones who are involved in the baby’s care. One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them. So, I wrote “mama” for each parent in the baby’s chart and in the birth parent’s chart. I made sure all my colleagues were using the correct terms to refer to the parents.   

As the family was leaving the hospital, the parents told me how much they appreciated being asked what they wanted to be called. I want all my patients to feel that I hear and care about them. I want their visit to feel as positive as possible, so they know they can come back, and they’ll feel comfortable that their care team is looking out for them.",Penn Medicine Experience,,1
