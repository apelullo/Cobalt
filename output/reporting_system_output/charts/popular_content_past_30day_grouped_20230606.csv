Assertiveness can help you express yourself effectively and stand up for your point of view. It can also help you do this while respecting the rights and beliefs of others.

Being assertive can also help boost your self-esteem and earn others' respect. This can help with stress management. It may especially help you reduce stress if you tend to take on too many responsibilities because you have a hard time saying no.

Some people seem to be naturally assertive. But if you're not assertive, you can learn to be.",Mayo Clinic Staff,,3

While decisions about who gets a ventilator would not be made by bedside nurses, if it does come to that we'll be in the emotionally and ethically horrifying position of watching patients suffocate, alone and in pain. That feels unbearable! Besides advocating with elected officials for more ventilators, begging everyone who can to stay at home, and doing our jobs well to try to keep everyone we can from decompensating, is there anything we can do? Is there any way we can contribute to the decision-making process if the hospital management has to develop a policy? Is there any conversation with palliative care or anesthesia about how to mitigate the suffering of patients who might not receive a ventilator?

A: You are not alone in worrying and wondering how critical care resources will be allocated in the setting of a crisis.  For this very reason, many states, including Pennsylvania, are creating crisis standards of care guidelines for situations where patient needs outnumber available critical care resources. These standards of care are activated when a regional, state, or federal authority has declared a public health emergency or disaster. The intent of the guidelines is rooted in ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number of patients and in making sure decisions are made fairly and objectively. The guidelines not only address resource allocation, but also pain management and palliative care, because it is never acceptable for patients to suffer as you’ve described. Although it will be unimaginably hard if we get to the point where we simply cannot provide critical care for all who may benefit from it, we will never stop caring for patients nor will we allow them to suffer. We all share the hope that these guidelines will not be needed. But we can all feel more secure knowing that we are prepared to address these serious issues and important decisions with a thoughtful, principled and consensus-driven process.","Scott Halpern, Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Penn",,1

I’m Lawrence Pratt, and my colleague Marchant Johnson and I are security guards at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC). Recently, a young man came into the hospital in police custody. He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.  

Sometimes when people see my uniform, I can tell from their body language that their defenses are up. What Marchant and I try to do is show that we’re fair and understanding. We want to find out what that person needs, and how we can help them. I tell people that in order to get what you want; you may have to bend a little so that you can get what you need.

My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.
