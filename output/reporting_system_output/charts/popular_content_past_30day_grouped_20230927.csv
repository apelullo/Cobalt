I shared that I’m a cis-gender white woman, and I have biases that come from the privileges my identity provides me. I said that I speak about gender diversity from a position of empathy, with an understanding of the science, but without lived experience. This leaves me with blind spots and room for growth. I hoped that by being open about my own perspective, our providers would feel like it’s okay to not be an expert, and would be more open to learning.  


 I developed the Gender Talk series because I want to educate our providers about gender identity and empower them to create a gender-affirming environment at work for each other and for our patients. I also wanted to model how we can acknowledge the limits of our understanding about what our patients have experienced in their lives.  

 What our providers need, in addition to research-supported information, is to hear from someone with lived experience. We invited Jillian Celentano, a transgender patient advocate and social worker, to join us as one of our featured speakers.  

 As Jillian has said, “I emphasize how important it is to talk about pronouns, to use the right terminology when speaking to trans and nonbinary patients. That makes all the difference to us.” Jillian also answered specific questions from providers, and told them how essential medical and mental health providers are in the community. “We can’t do this journey without you, but we’re also scared,” she added. Jillian shared how making small but important changes around how we interact with trans and nonbinary patients can make them feel much more comfortable in the health care setting.  

After our first Gender Talk series, I made sure that we were making those small but important changes, like having pronouns on our badges, correcting patients’ armband text, and introducing ourselves using our pronouns. Recently, I was talking to a patient who was very ill and had survived violence based on their gender identity. The patient pulled me aside and told me they didn’t usually feel safe in hospitals, but that the interactions with our staff felt positive. This made it possible for the patient to feel safe and respected.  

 Making progress in this area is very meaningful to the trans and nonbinary community. These steps we’re taking will go a long way towards achieving health equity, where every person seeking care is acknowledged, respected, and understood.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

It ensures that each of us take responsibility for the service we deliver and when problems occur, we accept responsibility and make it right. We are accountable when we:

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed. Take responsibility for the outcomes of the projects and tasks performed individually, as well as team projects and tasks. Set goals, track progress and hold others accountable for completion of tasks and projects. Provide honest, direct and balanced feedback to others on performance and impact.

They are the ones holding a woman’s hand and providing emotional support during labor. They are the ones changing dressings and swapping out bedpans.

Healthcare employees, particularly nurses, are at an increased risk for workplace violence. Earlier this month, we covered some of the statistics on workplace violence in healthcare, including the fact that from 2002 to 2013, incidents of serious workplace violence (those requiring days off for the injured) were four times more common in healthcare than in the overall private industry.

The providers are still writing ""elective induction of labor"" next to patients who are between 39.0 and 39.6 weeks' gestation. If they are still considering them as elective, why are we scheduling these elective labor procedures? Elective inductions keep women in hospital beds for more hours/days, when I would think we would need the beds freed up for patients with COVID-19. We want to reduce the number of people, in general, who are in the hospital.

A: The term “elective” is often used to describe procedures for which there is no medical indication. As you know, the health system is currently canceling many elective surgeries and procedures in order to keep patients without acute care needs out of the hospital during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. For a surgery that can be rescheduled later this year with no health consequences for the patient, this makes sense. However, childbirth is unique in that it absolutely has to happen- no one at the end of their third trimester can postpone giving birth for several months.

In the past, researchers believed that labor induction increased the risk of cesarean delivery. Typically, women who deliver via cesarean spend more time as inpatients than women who deliver vaginally. In 2018, the ARRIVE study (A Randomized Trial of Induction Versus Expectant Management) concluded that the risk of cesarean delivery is not increased by induction of labor in the 39th week of pregnancy and therefore does not lead to much longer hospital stays for post-partum women. This is great news for pregnant women interested in induction and has the double effect of helping hospitals prepare for a potential “surge” of patients during COVID-19 although the practice began before the current pandemic. Women who are ready to give birth and who are at least 39 weeks pregnant, can be induced now, with no fetal risk and no increased risk of a cesarean delivery.",Sindhu K. Srinivas,,1

I know we are very active in taking care of this population, but I would like to contribute in another way.  Because so many people are staying home and we are likely to experience a blood shortage, is there any way to donate as an employee right now?
We are most grateful to Don L. Siegel, Ph.D., M.D., Professor of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Director, Division of Transfusion Medicine & Therapeutic Pathology for providing the content to answer this question:

A: The American Red Cross at its national level has added additional donor criteria to its questionnaire in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One of the new criteria which you may have encountered when speaking with the Red Cross or when completing their online day-of-collection screening tool is a disqualification if you “have cared for a patient with COVID-19”.  While we wait for clarification on what is meant by  “cared for”, at this point healthcare workers “working with CV-19 patients” probably meet this disqualification.  Though respiratory viruses, including corona viruses like the common cold, SARS and MERS, are not believed to be transmitted through transfusion because there has not been a case of them being transmitted through blood, the extensive panel of infectious disease tests donor blood undergoes does not include tests for these viruses and probably never will.  At this time, there is a theoretical concern by the Red Cross in transfusing blood components into patients that were collected from donors who might have some clinically inapparent level of COVID-19 viremia.  So, at this point there is no way to donate blood as an employee or otherwise.
 
However, clinical studies involving heath care workers are being launched at  Penn on HUP healthcare workers as well as on recovered patients to understand the basic virology and immune response to the virus.  You might have antibodies to the virus and never know that you were infected. The link for that set of studies is below.  There is also a convalescent plasma collection protocol for recovered patients that meet must meet certain FDA criteria.  The plasma will be transfused into the patients you are caring for at HUP.  The link for that is below as well.  But right now, to qualify, you must have had a positive COVID-19 test that is now negative and been 14 days symptom-free.  This criteria may change to simply having a negative COVID-19 test now and the presence of antibodies in your blood.  So, in the near future, you might qualify for that as well.
