How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support. And as always, if you feel bullied and hence unsafe, SafetyNet remains an available resource to make your concerns known.",Jody Foster & Aliza Narva,,5

My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,3

I loved being one of the first people to greet patients and their families when they walked in the door. The way I saw it, my role was to help create an environment in which everyone feels welcome.  




 Several years later, I was able to apply my hospitality skills to a new role in Patient and Guest Relations, and I am still one of the first faces people see. As patient experience coordinator, I work closely with patients, providers, and administrators to ensure our patients get the best possible care. There are times when our patients don’t feel understood. I’m fortunate that in my role I get to listen to patients, find out what their needs are, and then communicate those needs to staff. Sometimes it’s as simple as going to get a breast pump for a new parent or working with a translator to discuss a patient’s options for care.  




Making people feel welcome is vital to establishing trust and providing equitable care. One way to build trust is to expand our connections in the community. Working alongside a team at PAH, I helped create a pathway program that partnered with two local charter schools. This year, we hired 10 high school graduates from the class of 2022 who are interested in health care careers and want to attend college using the UPHS tuition assistance benefit.  




The students rotate through multiple departments during their four-month paid internship. After the rotation ends, each student is matched with the department that’s the right fit for them and continues as full-time staff.  




 In addition to providing employment, we offer mentorship in the health care field. In one case, we had a patient services associate who wanted to become a phlebotomist. We paired her with the director of the laboratory so she could find out what classes to take and ask questions about the job she was pursuing.  




 The idea is to bring students in before they’ve made career choices and let them know what’s possible. It’s one small way to broaden our reach and help all who walk through our doors feel welcome.",Penn Medicine Experience,,2

A: We greatly appreciate your comments. As you note, the anxiety associated with this crisis is profound and based entirely in reality. The perceived “real root” of anxiety may differ for each of us—for you and many others it may be insufficient PPE that might lead to infecting family but for others it may be entirely different features of what the virus brings. The real root is ultimately the virus itself, and many, many others are working to contain it. We each contribute what we can, and the PennMedicineTogether effort simply hopes to offer resources and strategies for people who want help with the anxiety symptoms that this crisis has caused or exacerbated. This is not designed to encourage yoga or mindfulness but rather to offer strategies that help people cope, which we all do differently.

We are also wearing surgical masks and reusing them (so far, same mask for almost 2 weeks). Meanwhile, some who are not performing direct care are walking around in N95s. We understand that what is recommended is that one surgical mask be reused until visibly soiled or damaged. It is very frustrating to not hear the hospital just admit that reusing surgical masks for 2 weeks is completely inappropriate in any scenario. It may be NECESSARY because of shortages, but it's being phrased as if we have nothing to worry about by reusing single use masks. We are health care providers who are trained to know that this is untrue! When COVID-19 ""calms down,"" and we are back to ""regular"" supply use, it will again be seen as completely inappropriate to reuse PPE. Why is there no acknowledgement of this fact now? If it's what we have to do because of shortages, fine, but there is no need to tell us that a 2 week old mask is appropriate protection unless we are intubating or suctioning. We literally just completed a Knowledge Link on this topic within the last few months.   In addition, our patients cannot be isolated or quarantined in house, and those who are showing symptoms cannot be forced to wear masks, though we do encourage adherence as much as possible. While we understand the need for available psychiatric treatment, I think we expect a better explanation of why we continue to admit voluntary patients who are febrile, coughing, and not tested!   We feel voiceless and disposable. It seems like every concern brought up is met with vague acknowledgement but no answers, and while we understand that there are many unknowns, the lack of transparency is causing irreparable distrust.

One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them. So, I wrote “mama” for each parent in the baby’s chart and in the birth parent’s chart. I made sure all my colleagues were using the correct terms to refer to the parents.

I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic.

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand.
