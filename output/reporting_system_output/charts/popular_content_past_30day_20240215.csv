If we are lucky, when we stumble into bed at night, we might have crossed off a handful of tasks. We have trouble sleeping as we think about all of the things we failed to do. For some reason, in the middle of the night, the size of these tasks is exaggerated. When we get up the next day, we are sleep deprived and racked with guilt, ready to begin yet another day of being behind. This vicious cycle goes on day after day, month after month, year after year. In this age of 24/7 connectivity, if we take a “vacation,” we continue to do work, and if we don't, we feel guilty. The fatigue, disorganization, and sense of loss of control usually leads to reduced productivity and quality of our efforts, both professional and personal. The stress and anxiety take up valuable time and energy. Anxiety eats brainpower. How do we break this cycle?

Healthcare employees, particularly nurses, are at an increased risk for workplace violence. Earlier this month, we covered some of the statistics on workplace violence in healthcare, including the fact that from 2002 to 2013, incidents of serious workplace violence (those requiring days off for the injured) were four times more common in healthcare than in the overall private industry.

Recently I was talking to a new patient about her Type 2 diabetes. Her blood sugars were too high, and I was encouraging her to start insulin treatment. I told her about the treatment and shared statistics about the outcomes, but I could see that I wasn’t getting through. She seemed tuned out as I continued talking.  

Suddenly her gaze fell on my wedding ring. “Are those Hebrew letters?” she asked. I told her they come from the Song of Solomon: “I am to my beloved as my beloved is to me.” Her eyes softened, and she smiled at me as she shared, “That has always been my favorite Biblical poem!”  

She asked if I’m Jewish, and I said that I am. She told me she is very involved in her church, and draws strength from that community. For the rest of our time together, we chatted about religions and the ways in which they challenge and comfort us. I didn’t mention insulin again, but urged her to return to the clinic. She admitted that at first, she wasn’t planning to come back. But after our conversation, she was looking forward to her next visit.  

How someone feels is a big part of their health. We want to help people feel better, and help their health—those things go hand in hand.

 As a social worker in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN), I serve the whole family: the baby, the birth parent, and any other parents or loved ones who are involved in the baby’s care. One family I worked with was a same sex-couple with a baby boy. It’s standard to refer to parents as “mom” and “dad” in the ICN, but those terms don’t fit every family. After speaking with this couple and visiting with the baby, I went to my office to write up my notes. I realized that I needed to find out the correct terms to call the parents.   

I went back to their room and asked them what they wanted their baby to call them when he got older. They said “mama” is fine, or whatever he wants to call them. So, I wrote “mama” for each parent in the baby’s chart and in the birth parent’s chart. I made sure all my colleagues were using the correct terms to refer to the parents.   

As the family was leaving the hospital, the parents told me how much they appreciated being asked what they wanted to be called. I want all my patients to feel that I hear and care about them.
