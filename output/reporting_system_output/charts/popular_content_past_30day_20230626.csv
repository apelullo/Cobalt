My patient was an elderly woman who had late-stage cancer. When I got to her room, I heard from the nurses that she had not slept well. Like many people with dementia, she had her days and nights confused and was restless. I started by giving her a bath because sometimes that helps people wake up. She was a little bit agitated, so I thought about how I could make her feel more comfortable.  

The only real barrier between us was language — I don’t speak any Vietnamese, Thai, or Arabic, which were my patient’s languages, and she didn’t speak any English. We had tried using the interpreter service, but my patient wasn’t really engaging with it.  

 I decided to look for Thai music to play on my phone for her. I saw that the music soothed her, and she sat up in bed and let me hold her hand. She even seemed to be singing along with it.  

 Later that day, a friend of my patient came to visit her. She told me my patient was actually saying her prayers, not singing. I looked up Thai prayers and began playing those on my phone. Our culture, our beliefs are so important to who we are, and it really helped me to care for my patient when I learned more about her.  

 After her friend left, I brought out a basket of clean towels and told her that I’d washed some clothes and needed help folding them. She folded up the towels, then I put them in a pile and quietly moved them back to the basket so she could fold them again. Everyone folds laundry, and I wanted her to feel like she was doing something normal that she would do in her daily life.  

It’s like I was hanging out with my grandma — she just speaks a different language than I do.",Penn Medicine Experience,,6

While decisions about who gets a ventilator would not be made by bedside nurses, if it does come to that we'll be in the emotionally and ethically horrifying position of watching patients suffocate, alone and in pain. That feels unbearable! Besides advocating with elected officials for more ventilators, begging everyone who can to stay at home, and doing our jobs well to try to keep everyone we can from decompensating, is there anything we can do? Is there any way we can contribute to the decision-making process if the hospital management has to develop a policy? Is there any conversation with palliative care or anesthesia about how to mitigate the suffering of patients who might not receive a ventilator?

A: You are not alone in worrying and wondering how critical care resources will be allocated in the setting of a crisis.  For this very reason, many states, including Pennsylvania, are creating crisis standards of care guidelines for situations where patient needs outnumber available critical care resources. These standards of care are activated when a regional, state, or federal authority has declared a public health emergency or disaster. The intent of the guidelines is rooted in ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number of patients and in making sure decisions are made fairly and objectively. The guidelines not only address resource allocation, but also pain management and palliative care, because it is never acceptable for patients to suffer as you’ve described. Although it will be unimaginably hard if we get to the point where we simply cannot provide critical care for all who may benefit from it, we will never stop caring for patients nor will we allow them to suffer. We all share the hope that these guidelines will not be needed. But we can all feel more secure knowing that we are prepared to address these serious issues and important decisions with a thoughtful, principled and consensus-driven process.","Scott Halpern, Professor of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Penn",,1

I shared that I’m a cis-gender white woman, and I have biases that come from the privileges my identity provides me. I said that I speak about gender diversity from a position of empathy, with an understanding of the science, but without lived experience. This leaves me with blind spots and room for growth. I hoped that by being open about my own perspective, our providers would feel like it’s okay to not be an expert, and would be more open to learning.  


 I developed the Gender Talk series because I want to educate our providers about gender identity and empower them to create a gender-affirming environment at work for each other and for our patients. I also wanted to model how we can acknowledge the limits of our understanding about what our patients have experienced in their lives.  

 What our providers need, in addition to research-supported information, is to hear from someone with lived experience. We invited Jillian Celentano, a transgender patient advocate and social worker, to join us as one of our featured speakers.  

 As Jillian has said, “I emphasize how important it is to talk about pronouns, to use the right terminology when speaking to trans and nonbinary patients. That makes all the difference to us.” Jillian also answered specific questions from providers, and told them how essential medical and mental health providers are in the community. “We can’t do this journey without you, but we’re also scared,” she added. Jillian shared how making small but important changes around how we interact with trans and nonbinary patients can make them feel much more comfortable in the health care setting.  

After our first Gender Talk series, I made sure that we were making those small but important changes, like having pronouns on our badges, correcting patients’ armband text, and introducing ourselves using our pronouns. Recently, I was talking to a patient who was very ill and had survived violence based on their gender identity. The patient pulled me aside and told me they didn’t usually feel safe in hospitals, but that the interactions with our staff felt positive. This made it possible for the patient to feel safe and respected.  

 Making progress in this area is very meaningful to the trans and nonbinary community. These steps we’re taking will go a long way towards achieving health equity, where every person seeking care is acknowledged, respected, and understood.",Penn Medicine Experience,,1

I’m Lawrence Pratt, and my colleague Marchant Johnson and I are security guards at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC). Recently, a young man came into the hospital in police custody. He was headed to another facility to get psychiatric support, but first, he needed to stay overnight with us. In the morning, he was very agitated and upset.  

I was the first person from Security to arrive at his room. He was standing up and raising his voice. I waited for a quiet moment, then I asked him the question I always start with: “How can I help you make your situation better?”  

He answered that he wanted to go home and rest. I said, “I understand. In order to do that, you need to calm down and allow our staff to treat you.” We kept talking, and he said he was hungry. I brought him a snack, and the nurse gave him the medication he needed.  

Once he was able to regain his composure, the patient sat on his bed and listened to what his provider was telling him about his care. Twenty minutes later, he was discharged from the hospital.  

Sometimes when people see my uniform, I can tell from their body language that their defenses are up. What Marchant and I try to do is show that we’re fair and understanding. We want to find out what that person needs, and how we can help them. I tell people that in order to get what you want; you may have to bend a little so that you can get what you need.
