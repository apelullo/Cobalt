How can I advocate for myself (and my colleagues) with a difficult person during this stressful time?

A: Bullying is unacceptable now, as it is at any time. It is true that people are being asked to flexibly alter their roles as necessary, but it is also true that you should receive the necessary support to be able to do so. We will suggest that you approach your supervisor again and be clear that you are willing to take on new roles but that you need support in order to be able to do so (which ideally you can define for your supervisor). It may well be that your supervisor, who is stressed as we all are, is hearing your anxiety as reluctance or refusal and just getting more stressed or annoyed. If this does not do the trick then the next step remains HR and, if you take this route, we would again suggest that you be clear that you are willing to do alternate work but anxious and in need of training and support.

It ensures that each of us take responsibility for the service we deliver and when problems occur, we accept responsibility and make it right. We are accountable when we:

-Recognize that other team members and Penn Medicine's success depends on the results of our individual work. 
-Use open, proactive communication to keep team members informed of the status of our commitments because it has a direct impact on their ability to achieve their own commitments.

Being accountable means we: 

-Take initiative
-Own the problem
-Take steps to resolve the issue on our own, if possible.

If the steps taken don’t work, we escalate to the department or service that can assist.
Take responsibility for results and don’t assume it’s someone else’s responsibility. When team members consistently demonstrate accountability, trust is formed. Take responsibility for the outcomes of the projects and tasks performed individually, as well as team projects and tasks. Set goals, track progress and hold others accountable for completion of tasks and projects. Provide honest, direct and balanced feedback to others on performance and impact.

Being accountable is critical to delivering the Penn Medicine Experience for our patients and for each other.
Focus on ""Ensuring Accountability,"" and take ownership of problems using a solution-oriented approach to overcome challenges.
