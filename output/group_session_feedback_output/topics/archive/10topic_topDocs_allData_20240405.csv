(i'm good at time management and am always looking for ways to improve, especially given that my living situation changed rather drastically a bit over a year ago.) 3 things: 1. i'd never heard of the eisenhower decision matrix (great tool!); 2. the reinforcement that one should focus on what 'action choice' (for lack of a better word) will best reinforce my long-term desires; and 3. directly related to #2, the reinforcement of boundary definition. i just listened to a great 'dear sugars' podcast episode in which cheryl strayed & steve almond discuss 'saying no' with oprah winfrey. it's terrific--i can always use encouragement in this area (many people ask me for help!)--and this workshop did just that. thank you!! i can't think of anything. although i'm curious what other topics lily brown was planning to introduce (she said she ran out of time), i thought it was terrific. i've always been interested in habit formation and breaking down big tasks - and i love hearing different 'takes' on those topics!",Topic_0,time management,2023-09-12,lily
