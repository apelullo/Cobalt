(i'm good at time management and am always looking for ways to improve, especially given that my living situation changed rather drastically a bit over a year ago.) 3 things: 1. i'd never heard of the eisenhower decision matrix (great tool!); 2. the reinforcement that one should focus on what 'action choice' (for lack of a better word) will best reinforce my long-term desires; and 3. directly related to #2, the reinforcement of boundary definition. i just listened to a great 'dear sugars' podcast episode in which cheryl strayed & steve almond discuss 'saying no' with oprah winfrey. it's terrific--i can always use encouragement in this area (many people ask me for help!)--and this workshop did just that. thank you!! i can't think of anything. although i'm curious what other topics lily brown was planning to introduce (she said she ran out of time), i thought it was terrific. i've always been interested in habit formation and breaking down big tasks - and i love hearing different 'takes' on those topics!",Topic_0,time management,2023-09-12,lily
120,Topic_0,"nothing, anxiety, stress, strategies, use, family, tips, children, good, time","i like to hear other perspectives and approaches to this topic. it was good food for thought - good reinforcement of the kinds of things i review weekly i loved the tone, but i disliked 2 items: 1. the way i generated my honest list of priorities/values was first to consider how i spend my time, since i believe my actual choices are the clearest evidence of my priorities; so when we got to the second portion of the exercise, there was nothing for me to do. and 2. the emphasis on external motivation in the 'what would i like my legacy to be?' question. it's been my experience that modern people are very preoccupied with worrying about what others think of them instead of reaching deep to find their own values and practice them. in other words, i think a good legacy is an incidental by-product of healthy self-motivation. hope that makes sense! otherwise, as i say, i loved the tone of the course. i like lily brown's warm approach. stress management issues",Topic_0,getting reconnected to the _big picture_,2023-08-10,lily
